                  How to Use iss Version 6.0

Quick Start

     iss inserts lines starting with "//" into a C++/C/Java file 
so that you can easily add assembler code to the file.  iss 
inserts one or more "//" lines after any line that is not 
exclusively a comment, a blank line, "{", a directive, or a 
using statement.  iss will insert multiple lines at every 
insertion point if you specify a repetition count on the command 
line when you invoke iss.  The default repetition count is 5.  
For example, 

     iss  t.cpp

inserts 5 lines into t.cpp at every insertion point.

     iss  t.cpp /3

inserts 3 lines into t.cpp at every insertion point.  When
processing a file for the first time, iss creates a backup file
whose name is the same as the input file but with the extension 
".iss".  

     A negative repetition count removes lines previously 
inserted to which you have not added anything.  If you use a 
negative repetition count whose absolute value is as large or 
larger than the number of lines inserted at each insertion point, 
iss will remove all inserted lines that remain blank.  

     iss is useful when you are using the reverse comment feature 
of mas.  It relieves you of the task of creating lines starting 
with "//" to which you add assembler code.  Typically, after you 
add your assembler code, you would then invoke iss with a large 
negative repetition count to remove unused inserted lines.  If 
you wish to retain some of the unused lines, simply enter ";" 
after the "//" on the unused lines you wish to retain.  The 
insertion of ";" on a line changes its status to "used".  Thus, 
iss will now not remove it when operating with a negative 
repetition count. 

     You may use iss repeatedly on the same file with either 
positive or negative counts to add or remove lines, respectively. 

     If you use the /r command line argument, iss will restore 
the file to its original form, assuming you have not changed the 
original code.  That is, iss will remove all inserted lines 
(changed and unchanged). 

     Be sure to distinguish between a minus sign in a negative 
repetition count and the "/" or "-" that leads the repetition 
count argument.   For example, in 

     iss t -1

the repetition count is +1 (the "-" here is the command line 
argument marker).  For a -1 repetition count, enter 

     iss t /-1

or 

     iss t --1


Here is an example of the transformation iss performs.  If you 
enter

     iss  t 

where t.cpp is

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int x;
int main() 
{
   x = 5;
   cout << x << endl;
   return 0;
}


iss will modify t.cpp so that it is

//; iss of t.cpp  Your name: 
//
//
//
//
//
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int x;
//
//
//
//
//
int main() 
//
//
//
//
//
{
   x = 5;
//
//
//
//
//
   cout << x << endl;
//
//
//
//
//
   return 0;
//
//
//
//
//
}
//
//
//
//
//



Command Line Arguments

     All command line arguments are optional, can be specified in 
any order, must have no embedded spaces, and must be separated by 
at least one space. 

     All command line arguments, except <infilename>, must have a 
leading "/" or "-". 

     All command line arguments are case insensitive, except for 
filenames on systems with case-sensitive filenames. 

     The command line format is

     iss <infilename>  /count  /r   /?
                                    /h

If <infilename> has no extension, ".cpp" is assumed. 

/count is the number of lines to insert at each insertion point.  
The default value is 5.  The count can be positive or negative.  
A negative count deletes unchanged lines that were added on a 
previous run of iss. 

/h or /? displays a help screen.


Changing the Reverse Comment Delimiter

     Using the mod program, you can change the reverse comment 
delimiter that iss uses (in which case you should also use mod to 
similarly change the reverse comment delimiter that mas uses).  
This change would be necessary if you wanted to add assembler 
code to a C++/C/Java program that already had // comments.  
Changing the reverse comment delimiter would allow mas to 
distinuguish between the genuine // comments and the reverse 
comments containing assembler code. 


Problem with a Leading "/" in Command Line Arguments on Non-
Microsoft Systems

     Command line arguments typically start with "/" on Microsoft 
systems, and with "-" on other systems.  For the sake of 
uniformity, all the programs in the H1 Software Package allow a 
command line argument to start with EITHER "/" or "-" on any of 
the supported platforms.  Unfortunately, allowing "/" to start a 
command line argument on non-Microsoft systems can cause a 
problem.  For example, suppose you want to specify an input file 
on the command line.  Recall that an input file argument is not 
preceded by an argument marker.  For example in, 

    sim a /ms

the argument "a" (which specifies the input file a.mac) does NOT 
have a preceding "/" or "-".  "/ms", on the other hand, has the 
argument marker "/".  "/ms" is interpreted as the "/m" argument 
followed by the secondary argument "s".  Now suppose the input 
file you want to specify on the command line is 

     /abc.x

This denotes the abc.x file in the root directory "/".  
Unfortunately, all the programs in the H1 Software Package will 
interpret a leading "/" as an argument marker rather than as the 
root directory.  Thus, 

     /abc.x

on the command line is incorrectly interpreted as the argument 

     /a 

followed by the secondary argument

     bc.x

This problem does not occur on Microsoft systems because they use 
"\" rather than "/" as the filename separator, and, thus, there 
is never any confusion with the argument marker "/". 

You will probably rarely run into this problem because full 
pathnames are rarely needed when using the programs in the H1 
Software Package.  However, if the problem does occur, it can 
easily be circumvented: simply use "//" to represent the root.  
For example, if 

     //abc.x

appears on a command line, it is interpreted as the input file

     /abc.x

Do NOT use "//" in place of "/" within a command line argument.
For example, in the following invocation of sim,

     sim a /m/mnt/floppy/s.hor

the microcode file /mnt/floppy/s.hor is specified within the /m 
command line argument.  Thus, "//" should NOT be used in place of 
the leading "/" in "/mnt/floppy/s.hor". 


Default Settings

     iss is shipped with the following default settings:

     reverse comment delimiter: //
     message status:            messages on 
                                (i.e., non-error/non-warning 
                                console messages are displayed)

These settings, however, can be changed with the mod program.  
For information on the mod program, see mod.txt.

                 How to Use mex Version 6.1

Quick Start 

     mex (Module EXaminer) displays the contents of an object 
(".mob"), executable (".mac"), or library (".lib") file in hex 
and ASCII.  To use mex, enter 

     mex

mex then prompts the user for an input file name.  Enter this 
file name and/or any other desired command line arguments (any 
number of items per input line).  Once the input file name is 
entered, mex displays the contents of the file one screenful at a 
time.  After each screen is displayed, mex pauses for user input, 
which can be: 

    q or Q         Quit mex.  
    n or N         Nonstop--continue without pauses.
    Hit ENTER      Display the next group of lines.
                              
mex does not assume any default file name extension.  


Command Line Arguments

     All command line arguments are optional, can be specified in 
any order, must have no embedded spaces, and must be separated by 
at least one space. 

     All command line arguments, except <infilename>, must have a 
leading "/" or "-". 

     All command line arguments are case insensitive, except for 
filenames on systems with case-sensitive filenames. 

     The format of the command line is

   mex   <infilename>  /h   /l<lstfilename>
                       /?   /n

If <infilename> is specified on the command line, then mex will 
not prompt the user for additional input.  In response to a 
prompt, the user can enter <infilename> and/or other command line 
arguments.  Prompting ends whenever the user enters <infilename>.  
If <infilename> is omitted, mex prompts the user for it. 
If <infilename> starts with a pathname that starts with "/", then 
substitute "//" for the leading "/" in the pathname when entering 
<infilename>.  

/h or /? displays a help screen. 

If the /l argument is specified, screen output is written to a 
list file.  If <lstfilename> is specified with no extension, 
".mex" is appended to it.  If /l is specified without 
<lstfilename>, then <lstfilename> defaults to 

     <infilename_less_extension>.mex 

If /n is specified, a list file is not generated.  If neither the 
/l nor the /n arguments are specified, then the default setting 
is used (see the section "Default Settings" below). 


Problem with a Leading "/" in Command Line Arguments on Non-
Microsoft Systems

     Command line arguments typically start with "/" on Microsoft 
systems, and with "-" on other systems.  For the sake of 
uniformity, all the programs in the H1 Software Package allow a 
command line argument to start with EITHER "/" or "-" on any of 
the supported platforms.  Unfortunately, allowing "/" to start a 
command line argument on non-Microsoft systems can cause a 
problem.  For example, suppose you want to specify an input file 
on the command line.  Recall that an input file argument is not 
preceded by an argument marker.  For example in, 

    sim a /ms

the argument "a" (which specifies the input file a.mac) does NOT 
have a preceding "/" or "-".  "/ms", on the other hand, has the 
argument marker "/".  "/ms" is interpreted as the "/m" argument 
followed by the secondary argument "s".  Now suppose the input 
file you want to specify on the command line is 

     /abc.x

This denotes the abc.x file in the root directory "/".  
Unfortunately, all the programs in the H1 Software Package will 
interpret a leading "/" as an argument marker rather than as the 
root directory.  Thus, 

     /abc.x

on the command line is incorrectly interpreted as the argument 

     /a 

followed by the secondary argument

     bc.x

This problem does not occur on Microsoft systems because they use 
"\" rather than "/" as the filename separator, and, thus, there 
is never any confusion with the argument marker "/". 

You will probably rarely run into this problem because full 
pathnames are rarely needed when using the programs in the H1 
Software Package.  However, if the problem does occur, it can 
easily be circumvented: simply use "//" to represent the root.  
For example, if 

     //abc.x

appears on a command line, it is interpreted as the input file

     /abc.x

Do NOT use "//" in place of "/" within a command line argument.
For example, in the following invocation of sim,

     sim a /m/mnt/floppy/s.hor

the microcode file /mnt/floppy/s.hor is specified within the /m 
command line argument.  Thus, "//" should NOT be used in place of 
the leading "/" in "/mnt/floppy/s.hor". 


Default Settings

     mex is shipped with the following default setting:

          list file status: list on
          message status:   messages on

This setting, however, can be changed with the mod program.  For 
information on the mod program, see mod.txt.

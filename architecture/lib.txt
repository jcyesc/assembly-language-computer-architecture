                    How to Use lib Version 6.1

Quick Start 

     lib (LIBrary creator) creates a library of modules that can 
be used with lin.  To use lib, enter 

     lib

lib then prompts the user for the names of the files that are to 
be combined into a library.  Enter these names and/or any other 
desired command line arguments (any number of items per input 
line).  lib will continue to prompt until the user hits ENTER 
without first entering an argument.  lib then combines all the 
files specified, and creates a ".lib" file whose basename is the 
basename of the first input file processed. 
     If a module name entered has no extension, ".mob" is 
appended to it.  An input file can be 

     - a previously created library,
     - a ".mac" file, or 
     - a ".mob" file. 


Command Line Arguments

     All command line arguments are optional, can be specified in 
any order, must have no embedded spaces, and must be separated by 
at least one space. 

     All command line arguments, except <infilename>, must have a 
leading "/" or "-". 

     All command line arguments are case insensitive, except for 
filenames on systems with case-sensitive filenames. 

     The format of the command line is

lib  <argument> <argument> . . .

where <argument> can be

<infilename>  
/h or /?
/a<ansfilename>  
/o<outfilename>  

If one or more input file names or answer files are specified on 
the command line, then lib will not prompt the user for 
additional input.  If an input file name starts with a pathname 
that starts with "/", then substitute "//" for the leading "/" in 
the pathname when entering the input file name. 

If lib detects an error in an argument ON THE COMMAND LINE, it 
generates an error message and terminates execution.  If, on the 
other hand, lib detects an error in an argument entered IN 
RESPONSE TO A PROMPT, lib does not terminate.  It, instead, 
allows the user to reenter. 

More than one <infilename> may be specified.  If an <infilename> 
has no extension, ".mob" is appended to it. 

/h or /? displays a help screen.

<ansfilename> is the name of an answer file.  An answer file 
contains a list of files names.  Each file specified is included 
in the library to be created.  More than one /a<ansfilename> may 
be specified.  If /a is specified but not followed by a file 
name, then the answer file name defaults to "lib.ans". 
                       
<outfilename> is the name of the library file to be created.
If <outfilename> has no extension, ".lib" is appended to it.       
If /o<outfilename> is omitted, then the output file name defaults 
to the basename of the first input file to which the extension 
".lib" is appended.


Search Path for Answer Files

     If a directory is specified by an /a argument, lib searches 
for the answer file in that directory.  Otherwise, lib searches 
for the answer file in the current directory and in the directory 
specified by the H1DIR environment variable, if any. 


Problem with a Leading "/" in Command Line Arguments on Non-
Microsoft Systems

     Command line arguments typically start with "/" on Microsoft 
systems, and with "-" on other systems.  For the sake of 
uniformity, all the programs in the H1 Software Package allow a 
command line argument to start with EITHER "/" or "-" on any of 
the supported platforms.  Unfortunately, allowing "/" to start a 
command line argument on non-Microsoft systems can cause a 
problem.  For example, suppose you want to specify an input file 
on the command line.  Recall that an input file argument is not 
preceded by an argument marker.  For example in, 

    sim a /ms

the argument "a" (which specifies the input file a.mac) does NOT 
have a preceding "/" or "-".  "/ms", on the other hand, has the 
argument marker "/".  "/ms" is interpreted as the "/m" argument 
followed by the secondary argument "s".  Now suppose the input 
file you want to specify on the command line is 

     /abc.x

This denotes the abc.x file in the root directory "/".  
Unfortunately, all the programs in the H1 Software Package will 
interpret a leading "/" as an argument marker rather than as the 
root directory.  Thus, 

     /abc.x

on the command line is incorrectly interpreted as the argument 

     /a 

followed by the secondary argument

     bc.x

This problem does not occur on Microsoft systems because they use 
"\" rather than "/" as the filename separator, and, thus, there 
is never any confusion with the argument marker "/". 

You will probably rarely run into this problem because full 
pathnames are rarely needed when using the programs in the H1 
Software Package.  However, if the problem does occur, it can 
easily be circumvented: simply use "//" to represent the root.  
For example, if 

     //abc.x

appears on a command line, it is interpreted as the input file

     /abc.x

Do NOT use "//" in place of "/" within a command line argument.
For example, in the following invocation of sim,

     sim a /m/mnt/floppy/s.hor

the microcode file /mnt/floppy/s.hor is specified within the /m 
command line argument.  Thus, "//" should NOT be used in place of 
the leading "/" in "/mnt/floppy/s.hor". 


Default Settings

     lib is shipped with the following default settings:

          message status: messages on (i.e., non-error/non-warning 
                          console messages are displayed) 

This setting, however, can be changed with the mod program.  For
information on the mod program, see mod.txt.

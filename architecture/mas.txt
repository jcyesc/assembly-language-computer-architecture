                    How to Use mas Version 6.1

Quick Start 

     mas (Machine-level ASsembler) translates the assembly 
language described in 

  ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE AND COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE USING C++ AND JAVA
           by Anthony J. Dos Reis, Course Technology, 2004

to machine language.  mas outputs a file with either a ".mac" or 
a ".mob" extension.  It uses a ".mac" extension when the source 
program contains no PUBLIC or EXTERN statements.  Otherwise, it 
uses a ".mob" extension.  ".mob" files are object modules that 
are combined by the linker to produce an executable module.  
".mac" files are directly executable. 

     To invoke mas, enter 

     mas

mas then prompts the user for the name of the input file 
containing the program to be translated.  Enter the input file 
name and/or other desired command line arguments (any number of 
items per input line).  If the input file name entered has no 
extension, ".mas" is appended to it.  As command line arguments 
are entered, mas continues to prompt for more arguments until an 
input file name is entered. 
     mas outputs a file whose name is either 

     <input_file_name_less_extension>.mac

or 

     <input_file_name_less_extension>.mob 


     Each line of the source program should be in the following
format (the square brackets surround optional items):

[<label> :]  [<mnemonic/directive>  [<operand>]]  [/<comment>]

<label> may start in any column.  <label> may be any sequence of 
letters, digits, "@", "$", and "_" that does not start with a 
digit from 0 to 9.  <comment> may be any sequence of characters.  
No more than one instruction may be specified per line.  
<mnemonic/directive> and <operand> must be separated by at least 
one space.  Spaces are optional to the left and right of the 
colon following <label>.  A semicolon may be used in place of "/" 
at the start of a comment.  Completely blank lines and lines with 
only "<label> :" are allowed. 


Command Line Arguments

     All command line arguments are optional, can be specified in 
any order, must have no embedded spaces, and must be separated by 
at least one space. 

     All command line arguments, except <infilename>, must have a 
leading "/" or "-". 

     All command line arguments are case insensitive, except for 
file names on systems with case-sensitive file names. 

     The format of the command line is

mas <infilename> /h /dec /i /l<lstfilename> /c<cfgfilename> /o<outfilename> 
                 /? /hex /s /n

If <infilename> is specified on the command line, then mas will 
not prompt the user for additional input.  In response to a 
prompt, the user can enter <infilename> and/or other command line 
arguments.  Prompting ends whenever the user enters <infilename>.  
If <infilename> has no extension, then ".mas" is appended to it. 
If <infilename> starts with a pathname that starts with "/", then 
substitute "//" for the leading "/" in the pathname when entering 
<infilename>.  

/h or /? displays a help screen.

If /dec is specified, a number in the source program is treated as 
decimal, unless it ends with an "h" or "H", in which case it is 
treated as hexadecimal.  If /hex is specified, a number is treated 
as hex, unless it ends with a "t" or "T" ("t" stands for base 
ten), in which case it is treated as a decimal.  If neither /dec 
nor /hex is specified, then the default setting is used (see the 
section "Default Settings" below). 

If /i is specified, labels are case insensitive.  If /s is 
specified, labels are case sensitive.  If neither /i nor /s is 
specified, then the default setting is used (see the section
"Default Settings" below).

If /l is specified, a list file is generated.  If /n is 
specified, a list file is not generated.  If neither /l nor /n is 
specified, then the default setting is used (see the section 
"Default Settings" below).  A list file name can optionally 
follow /l.  If a list file name is specified without an 
extension, then ".lst" is appended to it.  If the /l argument is 
specified without a file name, then the file name used is 

     <infilename_less_extension>.lst

Each line in a list file is truncated, if necessary, to avoid 
wraparound on an 80 column display.  The list file includes a 
listing of each line of the assembly program along with its 
corresponding location and object code.  It also includes a 
display of the symbol/cross-reference table.  At most 25 
characters of each symbol are displayed in the symbol/cross-
reference table.  If there is insufficient space for the internal 
table used to accumulate data for the cross-reference table, a 
cross-reference table is not written to the list file.  For the 
cross-reference table, the references made by an END, EXTERN, 
EQU, or PUBLIC directive are specified using the first address 
that follows the position of the directive in the program.  For 
example, suppose the following sequence appears in a list file: 

                        public x
7  *7    0001  y:       dw 1

Then the reference to x in the PUBLIC directive is listed using 7 
in the entry for x in the cross reference table. 

The /c argument is used to specify a configuration file.  A 
configuration file is used to reconfigure mas to a different 
assembly language.  See sim.txt for more information on 
configuration files.  If the both the /c argument and a !-
directive are omitted , then mas uses its default configuration 
(see the section "Default Settings" below).  If a configuration 
file name is specified without an extension, ".cfg" is appended 
to it.  If both the /c command line argument and a !-directive 
in an assembly language program are used, mas will use the 
command line argument and ignore the !-directive. 

The /o argument is used to specify the name of the output file.  
If <outfilename> is specified without an extension, then ".mac" 
or ".mob" is appended to it.  If the /o argument is omitted, then 
<outfilename> defaults to 

     <infilename_less_extension>.mac 

or 

     <infilename_less_extension>.mob


Addresses

     Addresses can be either absolute (i.e., a number) or 
symbolic (i.e., a label).  Labels are relocatable addresses--that 
is, addresses corresponding to labels are adjusted according to 
the load point in memory of the program.  Absolute addresses are 
not relocatable.


Types of Operands

     The operand field of an assembly language instruction 
can be of several types:

Note: "*" designates the current location

     Type                         Examples

    Number                          ld   24   

    Label                           st   sum

    Label + Unsigned_Number         ld   table + 4

    Label - Unsigned_Number         ld   table - 1

    * + Unsigned_Number             st   * + 2

    * - Unsigned_Number             st   * - 2

    *                               st   *

    String terminated
    with null character             dw   "X="
                               
    String not terminated
    with null character             dw   'X='

Strings are mapped to storage with one ASCII character per word.
Strings which are delimited with double quotes are terminated 
with the null character.  For example, the string "A" specifies
two words:

     0041    (the ASCII value of 'A')
     0000    (the null character)

In contrast, the string 'A' specifies only one word:

     0041    (the ASCII value of 'A')

The following escape sequences can be used:

     \n    newline
     \r    carriage return
     \a    bell
     \b    backspace
     \f    form feed
     \v    vertical tab
     \t    horizontal tab
     \0    null character
     \"    double quote
     \'    single quote
     \\    backslash

For example, the string consisting of three letters followed by
the newline character is:  

     'ABD\n' 

A null-terminated string of length zero or one or a non-null-
terminated string of length 1 can be used in the operand field on 
any instruction that takes an operand.  The ASCII value for the 
character in the string is placed in the operand field of the 
assembled instruction.  If a null-terminated string of length 
zero is specified, then zero is placed in the operand field.  For 
example, the instructions 

     ldc  'A'
     ldc  "A"

are both translated to 8041 (8 is the opcode for ldc; 41 is 
ASCII for 'A').  The instruction

     ldc  ""

is translated to 8000.  
     Strings may not span lines.  Thus, if a string requiring 
multiple lines is needed, it has to be defined with multiple 
consecutive DW directives.  The maximum length of an input line 
is 200 characters.  Thus, one line can define a string with a 
length up to 195 characters (five characters are needed for the 
DW directive, a space and two quotes). 


Range of x, y, and z Fields

     For maximum generality, mas allows both positive and 
negative values in the x, y, and z fields of instructions.
The allowable ranges are as follows:

     x field (4-bit opcode):  -4095 to 4095
     y field (8-bit opcode):  -255 to 255
     z field (12-bit opcode): -15 to 15


Directives

     mas supports six directives: DW, END, EQU, EXTERN, ORG, and 
PUBLIC, .  Each directive should be on a separate line.  
Placement of directives is not critical, except for DW or ORG. 


DW Directive--------------------------------------------------

     DW (define word) is used to define in memory one word (for 
numbers) or multiple words (for strings).  If a number follows 
"DW", then only one word is defined.  The range of the numbers 
can be from -32768 to 65535.  If a string follows "DW", then one 
word is defined for each character in the string, plus one word 
for the null character if double quotes are used.  For example, 

     dw    9

defines the word 0009.       

     dw "AB"

defines three words:  0041 (ASCII for 'A'),  0042  (ASCII for 
'B'), 0000 (the null character).

     dw 'AB'

defines two words:

     0041 (ASCII for 'A'), and 0042 (ASCII for 'B').


The storage defined by a DW directive can be replicated using the 
DUP modifier.  For example, 

     x:    dw   3 dup 10

is equivalent to

     x:    dw   10
           dw   10
           dw   10

DUP can be used with string constants as well as numeric 
constants.  For example, 

     y:    dw   2 dup "abc"

is equivalent to

     y:    dw   "abc"
           dw   "abc" 

The count that precedes "dup" must be unsigned and greater than 
or equal to 1. 


END Directive-------------------------------------------------

     The END directive is used to specify the entry point for 
the program.  The entry point can be specified as either an 
absolute address or a label.  For example, both
       
              end  start

and 

              end  29

are legal.  At most one END directive can appear in a program.  
If an END directive does not appear in a program, then the entry 
point defaults to the lowest location occupied by the program. 


EQU Directive-------------------------------------------------

     The EQU (equate) directive associates a numeric value with 
a symbol.  Wherever the symbol appears as an operand, the 
assembler substitutes its corresponding value.  For example, in 
the following program, 

          equ  x    3
          ld   x
          halt

the assembler substitutes 3 for x in the ld instruction.  Thus, 
the ld instruction is assembled as if it were written as 

          ld   3

The symbol in an equ should have the same form as a label.


EXTERN directive----------------------------------------------

     EXTERN declares a label to be external--that is, used within
the module that contains the EXTERN but defined in a separately
assembled module.  For example, here is a module that can call 
the "add_one" label in the module above:

              extern add_one
              ldc    10         / load 10 into ac register
              call   add_one    / call subroutine to add 1
              dout              / display the result
              halt

If the EXTERN directive did not appear in this module, then the
assembler would flag the call instruction as having an undefined 
label.


ORG Directive-------------------------------------------------

     The ORG directive resets the current address.  For 
example, in the program

           ld   x
           org  3
     x:    dw   256
     y     dw   333

the address of x is 3.  The locations skipped because of an ORG 
directive are set to 0.  Thus, the program above is equivalent to 

          ld    x
          dw    0
          dw    0
     x:   dw    256
     y:   dw    333


The ORG directive must specify an absolute address which is at 
least as big as the current address.


PUBLIC Directive----------------------------------------------

     PUBLIC makes a label a global--that is, referencable by a 
separately-assembled module.  For example, in the following 
module, the label "add_one" can be called from a separately 
assembled module: 

              public add_one
     add_one: add  @1
              ret
     @1:      dw   1

--------------------------------------------------------------


Specifying a Configuration File in the Input File

     A configuration file can be specified by the /c command line 
argument.  Alternatively, a configuration file can be specified 
in the input file with a !-directive.  A !-directive consists of 
"!" followed by the base name of the configuration file. 
     A !-directive, if one is specified, should appear at the 
beginning of the input file.  Only comments, completely blank 
lines, or a &-directive may precede the line containing a !-
directive.  A !-directive may start in any column.  However, if 
it does not start in the first column, it must have only white 
space to its left.  A comment may appear to the right of a !-
directive with at least one blank separating it from the !-
directive.
     If a configuration file is specified neither on the command 
line nor with a !-directive, then mas will use a default 
configuration file.  If the current setting of the default 
configuration file is "none", mas will use its built-in 
configuration file (which corresponds to the standard instruction 
set).  The default configuration file can be changed with the mod 
program (see mod.txt). 


Activating Memory-mapped I/O

     A &-directive, if one is specified, should appear at the 
beginning of the input file.  Only comment lines, completely 
blank lines, or a line containing a !-directive may precede a &-
directive.  A &-directive may start in any column.  However, if 
it does not start in the first column, it must have only white 
space to its left.  A comment may appear to the right of a &-
directive with at least one blank separating it from the &-
directive. 
     A &-directive consists of "&" followed immediately by an 
optional address in hex, or in decimal (if suffixed with "t").  
If an address is specified, it should follow "&" with no 
intervening spaces.
     The assembler ignores &-directives.  However, when sim runs 
a program whose assembler version contains a &-directive, it 
activates memory-mapped I/O using the address in the &-directive, 
if one is specified.  If an address is not specified in the &-
directive, sim uses the default address.


Search Path for Configuration File

     If a directory is specified by the /c argument, mas searches 
for the configuration file in that directory.  Otherwise, mas 
searches for the configuration file in the current directory and 
in the directory specified by the H1DIR environment variable, if 
any, in that order. 

     If a configuration file is specified by a !-directive, mas 
searches the directory in which the ".mas" file containing the !-
directive is located, and the directory specified by the H1DIR 
environment variable, if any, in that order. 


Too Few or Too Many Operands

     If the configuration file contains information on the number 
of operands, mas will check that instructions are specified with 
the correct number of operands.  If, on the other hand, the 
configuration file does not contain this information, mas will 
not check if there are too few or too many operands for any 
instruction.  In the latter case, if there are too few operands, 
mas will assemble the corresponding field to zero.  If there are 
too many, mas will ignore the excess.   Regardless of the 
configuration file, mas checks directives for missing operands. 


Multiple-word Instructions

     mas will assembly a mnemonic as a two-word instruction if 
the mnemonic and the number of operands in part 1 of the 
configuration file is followed on the same line by 2, with at 
least one intervening blank.  For example if the mnemonic entry 
for mult in part 1 of the configuration file is 

mult 1 2

then mas assembles mult as one-operand, two-word instruction.  
The first word of the assembled instruction will contain the 
opcode; the second word, the operand.  

     Instructions longer than two words are not directly 
supported.  However, they can still be included in an assembly 
language program by using dw directives to define those words in 
the instruction beyond the second.  For example, suppose LI is 
four-word instruction, consisting of a one-word opcode followed 
by three words, each containing the address of an operand.  If we 
indicate that LI is a two-word instruction in the configuration 
file, the following assembly language statements then define a 
single LI instruction: 

     li   a    ; defines first two words
     dw   b    ; defines third word
     dw   c    ; defines fourth word



^-Lines

     A ^-line (read as "caret line") is a line whose first non-
whitespace character is "^" (without the quotes).  mas processes 
^-lines last.  Thus, the effect of "^" on a line is to move it to 
the end of the program.  ^-lines allow constants to be defined in 
line with executable code, making reading and writing programs 
easier.  For example, consider the following code: 

          ldc    prompt
^prompt:  dw     "Enter integer"
          sout
          
          ; more executable code.
          

Although the dw is physically in line with the executable code, 
mas places it at the end of the program, out of the flow of 
control.  mas also creates a ".car" file (if the car file option 
is on and the program contains careted lines) that contains the 
original source code but with the ^-lines (now no longer starting 
with "^") at the end of the program.  For example, the code above 
would appear in the ".car" file (and in the ".lst" file) as 


          ldc    prompt
          sout
          
          ; more executable code.

; ===================== ^-lines follow ============
prompt:   dw     "Enter integer"


Notice that when mas moves a ^-line, it removes the "^".  If the 
line contains a label, the label and the ":" that follows it are 
moved to the left one position (filling in the position formerly 
occupied by the "^").  The rest of the line, however, maintains 
its columnar position.  If there is no label, then all the 
characters on a line maintain their columnar positions. 


Reverse Comments

     If a C++ program is commented with one-line comments each 
starting with "//", a C++ compiler will ignore these comments 
(because of the leading "//" on each comment).  If mas assembles 
the SAME code, mas will reverse the comments.  That is, mas will 
treat the "//" comments as assembly input, and the C++ code as 
comments to be ignored.  In addition, mas creates a "reverse 
file" with a ".mas" extension (if the reverse file option is on) 
and a ".lst" file (if the list file option is on) in which the 
C++ code appears as comments.  For example, consider the 
following C++ code: 


#include <iostream>   //; Sample program
using namespace std;
int x;                //x:        dw    0

int main() {          //main:

   x = 5;             //          ldc   5
                      //          st    x

   cout << x << endl; //          ld    x
                      //          dout
                      //          ldc   '\n'
                      //          aout

   return 0;          //          ldc   0
                      //          halt

}                     //          end   main


A C++ compiler can compile this code.  mas can also assemble this 
code by treating the "//" comments as assembly input.  Suppose 
the C++ code above is in a file name t.cpp.  Then to assemble the 
assembly code it contains, simply enter 

     mas t.cpp

Note that you must specify a ".cpp" extension or else mas assumes 
a ".mas" extension.  mas then creates the executable file t.mac 
which can be run on sim.  It also creates a list file t.lst in 
which the original C++ code now appears as comments: 


Machine-level Assembler Version 4.3    Wed Mar 23 10:49:16 2005

               main:                    ; int main() {

9  *9    ========= end of t.cpp ==================================


mas also creates a "reverse" file t.mas in which the C++ code 
appear as comments:

; Sample program         ; #include <iostream>   
                         ; using namespace std;
x:        dw    0        ; int x;                

main:                    ; int main() {          

          ldc   5        ;    x = 5;             
          st    x

          ld    x        ;    cout << x << endl; 
          dout
          ldc   '\n'
          aout

          ldc   0        ;    return 0;          
          halt

          end   main     ; }                      


The SD command in sim displays the ".mas" file corresponding to 
the ".mac" file sim is currently running.  Thus, when sim is 
running a ".mac" file corresponding to a ".cpp" file, the SD 
command displays the reverse file (because it has a ".mas" 
extension). 

Reverse commenting is in effect only if it is enabled and the 
extension on the input file is ".cpp", ".c", ".java", or ".jav".  

A reverse file is created only if reverse commenting is in 
effect and the reverse file option is on.

To create a reverse file, mas moves the C++/C/Java code to the 
right so that it starts in column 25, placing the assembly code 
to the left of column 25.  If a line of assembly code extends 
beyond column 25 in the reverse file, mas positions the C++ code 
on that line to the right of the assembly code. 

The delimiter for reverse comments can be changed by the mod 
program to any string starting with "//" followed by an optional 
third character.  For example, you can change it to "//!" or 
"//."  Thus, if the original C++/C/Java program has // comments, 
you can add your assembler code using a different delimiter (such 
as "//.").  Then mas will be able to distinguish between the 
program's original comments and the comments that hold assembler 
code. 

The C++ code start column can be changed by the mod program (the 
default value is 25). 

The reverse commenting feature of mas can be enabled or disabled 
with the mod program.  If it is enabled, it is activated when 
the input file has the extension ".cpp", ".c", ".java", or 
".jav".


Problem with a Leading "/" in Command Line Arguments on Non-
Microsoft Systems

     Command line arguments typically start with "/" on Microsoft 
systems, and with "-" on other systems.  For the sake of 
uniformity, all the programs in the H1 Software Package allow a 
command line argument to start with EITHER "/" or "-" on any of 
the supported platforms.  Unfortunately, allowing "/" to start a 
command line argument on non-Microsoft systems can cause a 
problem.  For example, suppose you want to specify an input file 
on the command line.  Recall that an input file argument is not 
preceded by an argument marker.  For example in, 

    sim a /ms

the argument "a" (which specifies the input file a.mac) does NOT 
have a preceding "/" or "-".  "/ms", on the other hand, has the 
argument marker "/".  "/ms" is interpreted as the "/m" argument 
followed by the secondary argument "s".  Now suppose the input 
file you want to specify on the command line is 

     /abc.x

This denotes the abc.x file in the root directory "/".  
Unfortunately, all the programs in the H1 Software Package will 
interpret a leading "/" as an argument marker rather than as the 
root directory.  Thus, 

     /abc.x

on the command line is incorrectly interpreted as the argument 

     /a 

followed by the secondary argument

     bc.x

This problem does not occur on Microsoft systems because they use 
"\" rather than "/" as the filename separator, and, thus, there 
is never any confusion with the argument marker "/". 

You will probably rarely run into this problem because full 
pathnames are rarely needed when using the programs in the H1 
Software Package.  However, if the problem does occur, it can 
easily be circumvented: simply use "//" to represent the root.  
For example, if 

     //abc.x

appears on a command line, it is interpreted as the input file

     /abc.x

Do NOT use "//" in place of "/" within a command line argument.
For example, in the following invocation of sim,

     sim a /m/mnt/floppy/s.hor

the microcode file /mnt/floppy/s.hor is specified within the /m 
command line argument.  Thus, "//" should NOT be used in place of 
the leading "/" in "/mnt/floppy/s.hor". 


Default Settings

     mas is shipped with the following default settings:

     number base:          decimal
     label status:         case sensitive
     list file status:     list on
     message status:       messages on (i.e., non-error/non-warning 
                           console messages are displayed)
     sym tab display:      enabled
     car file status:      car file on
     reverse comments:     enabled
     reverse delimiter:    //
     reverse file status:  reverse file on
     reverse start column: 25
     configuration file:   none (i.e., mas is configured for the 
                           standard instruction set)

These settings, however, can be changed with the mod program.  
For information on the mod program, see mod.txt.

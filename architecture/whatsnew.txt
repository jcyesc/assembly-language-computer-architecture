               H1 Software Package Version 6.1
                What's New Since Version 4.0
                     June 5, 2007

=================================================================
Updating the textbook with errata.txt

     Be sure to update your textbook with the corrections 
described in the latest errata.txt available from www.course.com.  


=================================================================
Potential name conflicts

     Some of the programs, batch files, and scripts in the H1 
Software Package have common names.  You may have programs, batch 
files, or scripts elsewhere on your system that are identically 
named.  Thus, when you attempt to invoke a program, batch file, 
or script in the H1 Software Package, you may, in fact, invoke 
one of these other programs, batch files, or scripts, depending 
on the search path in effect on your system.  The PATH commands 
described in the installation instructions in readme.txt place 
the current directory and the H1 directory FIRST in the search 
path, so you should always be able to invoke the programs in your 
current directory and in the H1 directory.  If, however, you are 
using a different search path, and a name conflict occurs, you 
can simply rename the programs in the H1 directory for which a 
conflict occurs to unique names.  For example, if you have a name 
conflict with "pic", you can rename pic to "h1pic".  
Alternatively, you can change your search path so that the H1 
directory is first.  


=================================================================
Using mod

     You can set the defaults for most programs in the H1 
Software Package according to your preferences using the mod 
program.  For information on what can be set, see the ".txt" file 
for the program you wish to modify and the file mod.txt.  You may 
want to make the "plus reads" display mode the default display 
mode in sim; or for maximum information, both "plus reads" and 
"plus source".  The "plus reads" display mode displays, in 
addition to the usual information, the address and contents on a 
memory read.  It is particularly helpful when tracing relative 
instructions.  The "plus source" mode, which displays the 
original assembly source code, can be very helpful when you are 
debugging. 

     Using the mod program, you can incorporate an identifying 
name into the sim executable file.  sim then will insert this 
name at the beginning of every log file.  This feature is 
convenient if you submit log files for homework assignments.  
When you use mod, if you enter your name with a leading period, 
sim will also incorporate your family name into the names of log 
files it creates (this feature is not available on DOS).  For 
example, if you enter the name 

.DosReis Anthony J

the log file created for, let's say, the program p412.mac would 
be "p412.dosreis.log" rather than "p412.log".  This feature is 
convenient if you submit log files, rather than printouts of log 
files, for homework assignments.  It allows your instructor to 
have all the students' files in a single directory without file 
name conflicts. 

     To incorporate your name into sim with mod, enter 

     mod sim

At the prompt, enter a name, family name first.  Then hit ENTER 
repeatedly until the prompt "Okay to change sim? Enter y or n." 
appears.  Then enter 

     y

An even easier way (starting with Version 5.0) to incorporate a 
name into sim is to enter 

     mod sim /r

The "/r" argument causes mod to use the response file sim.rsp 
which provides mod with all the required inputs, except for your 
name.  So the only thing you have to do is enter your name. 


=================================================================
require.txt

     require.txt contains a list of suggested requirements for 
your homework assignments.  Please consult with your instructor 
to determine the actual homework requirements in effect for your 
class. 


=================================================================
Archived files in the H1 Software Package

     The programs in the figures in the textbook are in 
figwin.zip (for Windows), figdos.zip (for DOS), or fig.tar.gz 
(for Sun, X86 Linux, or Macintosh OS X).  

     The programs in the end-of-chapter problems are ALREADY 
unarchived.  However, they are also in eocwin.zip (for Windows), 
eocdos.zip (for DOS), or eoc.tar.gz (for Sun, X86 Linux, or 
Macintosh OS X). 

     The answer files are ALREADY unarchived.  However, they are 
also in ans.zip (for Windows and DOS), or ans.tar.gz (for Sun, 
X86 Linux, or Macintosh OS X). 

     See the end of readme.txt for a complete list of the files 
in the H1 Software Package. 


=================================================================
Consistent use of the hyphen in debugger commands

     sim now uses "-" as an argument suffix in debugger commands 
more uniformly and consistently.  It is used to turn off a 
feature.  For example, B sets a breakpoint; B- kills (i.e., turns 
off) a breakpoint.  In particular: 

  -  You can kill a machine-level breakpoint with 
     either B- or with K. 

  -  You can kill a microlevel breakpoint with 
     either b- or with k. 

  -  You can kill a watchpoint with either W- or with
     KW.

  -  You can turn off machine-level "source only" mode 
     with either MSO- or with MS-. 

  -  You can turn off "plus reads" mode with MR-.

  -  You can turn off "plus counts" mode with MC-.

  -  You can turn off microlevel "source only" mode 
     with either mso-  or with ms-.

  -  You can turn off the log file with L-.

  -  You can turn off memory-mapped I/O with I-.


=================================================================
Improved plus reads mode

     The new "plus reads" mode (activated by the mr command--see 
page 132 in the textbook) displays on a memory read operation the 
contents in addition to the address (the old version does not 
display the contents).  This additional information--the memory 
contents on a read--can be very useful when you are debugging or 
tracing a program.  The following samples show the difference 
between the old "plus reads" display and the new display: 


                Old
                ---

  5: subr /7 005/ [069]  ac=000E/0005  
                    ^
                    |
                    +-------------- address





                New
                ---

  5: subr /7 005/ 0009<m[069]  ac=000E/0005  
                   ^      ^
                   |      |
                   |      +-------- address
                   +--------------- contents



=================================================================
Source-level tracing

     sim has two types of source options (i.e., modes in which 
source code is displayed): "plus source" and "source only".  In 
the latter, only source code is displayed.  In the former, all 
the activity associated with the execution of each instruction 
PLUS its source code is displayed.  

     If the source code at either the machine or microlevels is 
out-of-date (because of changes either you or the executing 
program makes), it is still displayed when sim is in a source 
mode, but with a leading "+" to indicate that it is out-of-date.  
The "+" symbol appears both in the trace and in the output 
produced by the U/u commands.  If you wish to see the up-to-date 
instruction in symbolic form, use the UO/uo (unassemble one) 
commands to unassemble the hex code displayed by the U/u commands 
(the hex code represents the current contents of main memory, 
and, therefore, is always up-to-date).  Alternatively, you can 
cancel the "plus source" or "source only" option with the MS-/ms- 
commands--then the symbolic code displayed by the U/u commands is 
always up-to-date (it is unassembled from what is currently in 
memory).  

     When the machine-level "plus source" or "source only" option 
is active, debugger commands that take address arguments will 
accept labels as well as numbers for addresses.  For example, 
after activating the machine-level "plus source" option with the 
MS command, you can set a breakpoint at the location 
corresponding to the label "loop" in your program with 

     Bloop

Labels can be used in the A, B, D, E, F, J, U, and W commands 
when the machine-level "plus source" or "source only" option is 
active.  You can similarly use labels at the microlevel when the 
microlevel "plus source" or "source only" option is active. 

     If a label matches a hex constant, sim will treat it as a 
hex constant.  For example, the command 

     Bf1

sets a breakpoint at location f1 hex, even if there is a label 
"f1".  To force sim to treat "f1" as a label, prefix it with 
either a single or double quote (the terminating quote is 
optional) .  For example, to set a breakpoint at the label "f1", 
enter 

     B'f1

or

     B'f1'

or   

     B"f1

or

     B"f1"

A quote is also necessary in the a, e, and d commands if the 
label is "@" or "$" (to avoid treating the label as the symbolic 
argument "@" (ac reg contents) or "$" (stack reg contents), or 
if it is "h" and you are using the d command (dh is the decimal-
to-hex command), or if it is "o" and you are using the u command 
(uo is the unassemble one command).  

The built-in assemblers (that are invoked with the A/a commands) 
can process pre-existing labels when sim is in a source mode.  
New labels, however, cannot be created with these assemblers. 

     If the "plus source" or "source only" option is active and 
instruction execution occurs for an address for which no source 
code is available, sim will automatically (and temporarily) 
switch to a non-source display mode.  Once execution is back in 
a region for which source is available, sim automatically 
reactivates the source mode from which it switched.


=================================================================
Instruction Profiling

     When the "plus source" or the "source only" option at the 
machine-level is activated with the MS or MSO command, 
respectively, the U command, for each address, will display the 
address IN HEX, the reference count IN DECIMAL, the contents of 
main memory in hex, and the source code from which the code in 
memory was assembled.  The reference count for an address is the 
number of reads and writes to that address mod 1000000 (65536 for 
the DOS version of sim).  That is, the count wraps around to zero 
when it reaches 1,000,000 (or 65,536 on DOS).  Reference counts 
provide a "profile" of the execution and data reference pattern 
of the program.  The u command at the microlevel behaves 
similarly when the "plus source" or "source only" option at the 
microlevel is activated with the ms or mso command, respectively.  


=================================================================
/a debugger command (case insensitive)

     When the /a command is entered from within the debugger, sim 
executes the debugger commands in the answer file corresponding 
the to ".mac" file it is running.  These commands create a log 
file containing everything required for your homework assignment 
(your name, time stamp, program statistics, test runs, source 
code, and the correct/NOT CORRECT evaluation of the program 
verifier).  For example, for Problem 4.12, you should create an 
assembly language file p412.mas which assembles to p412.mac.  
When you run p412.mac on sim and enter /a, sim uses the answer 
file p412.ans to create the log file p412.log (or 
p412.yourname.log, depending on how you incorporated your name 
into sim with mod--with or without a leading period). 

     Each programming problem has a corresponding answer file 
whose name reflects the problem number.  For example the answer 
file for Problem 2.1 is p21.ans.  

     When sim is running a ".mac" file, it determines the answer 
file from the ".mac" file name.  For example, when sim runs 
p412.mac, it uses the answer file p412.ans when the /a command is 
entered.  However, for the problems in Chapter 2, you do not 
create ".mac" files.  Instead, you specify "none" for the ".mac" 
file name and you enter the machine code directly into memory 
using the e (edit) command.  Because there is no ".mac" file for 
these programs, you must explicitly specify an answer file when 
you use the /a command.  For example, for Problem 2.1, you should 
enter 

     /ap21

in which case sim uses p21.ans to create the log file p21.log (or 
p21.yourname.log).  For the problems starting with Chapter 3 
(for which you create ".mac" files with mas), you simply enter 

     /a

in which case sim creates a log file with the same base name as 
the ".mac" file you are running. 

     /a is a new debugger command--it is entered from within the 
debugger.  /a is also a command line argument that can be 
specified when you invoke sim.  It has the same effect as the
/a debugger command.

     The H1 Software Package also contains a generic answer file, 
any.ans, that you can use for programs for which no answer file 
exists.  For microprogramming assignments for which no answer 
file exists, you can use the generic answer file anymicro.ans.  
You can also use none.ans--a generic answer file for programs 
entered directly into memory (i.e., when "none" is entered for 
the machine code file name).  

     Starting with Version 6.0, sim's program verifier can check 
if a program's size and instruction counts (both machine and 
micro) are within prescribed limits (in addition to checking for 
correct output).  This additional capability is triggered 
automatically if the first line of an answer file has size and 
count data in addition to a checksum.  For more information on 
this new capability, see the discussion of the /a command in 
sim.txt. 

     For more information on the program verifier, see the file 
require.txt in the H1 Software Package. 


=================================================================
LD Debugger Command (Case insensitive)

     The debugger now supports the LD (log display) command that 
allows you to see any portion of the log file while sim is still 
in its debugger.  For example, the debugger command 

     LD 100t

displays the log file starting 100 lines back from its current 
end (note that without the "t" suffix, sim would interpret "100" 
as a hex number). 
    
      LD^

displays the log file one screen back from the current point.

      LD

displays the log file one screen forward from the current point.  


=================================================================
Batch/script files

     The H1 Software Package contains several batch/script files
that simplify the use of mas, lin, and sim.  Each of these files 
contain a sequence of commands.  Whenever you invoke one of these 
files, you are, in effect, invoking the sequence of commands it 
contains.

     aa   - assemble and run with /a in effect.

     arun - assemble and run (without the debugger)

     asim - assemble and run (with the debugger)

     run  - run a previously assembled program.  

 
     You will not have any use for the following batch 
     files/scripts until you cover Chapter 10 in the textbook: 

     runc - like run, except runc also generates a message
            that depends on the return code returned by sim,
            If you want to use runc, you should turn on sim's
            return code option using the mod program.

     aka  - assemble, link with stack start-up code
            and run with /a in effect.

     akr - assemble, link with stack start-up code, run
           with debugger inactive

     aks - assemble, link with stack start-up code, run
           with debugger active

     ala  - assemble, link with standard start-up code
            and run with /a in effect.

     alr - assemble, link with standard start-up code, run
           with debugger inactive

     als - assemble, link with standard start-up code, run
           with debugger active

     caka - like cakr but run sim with the /a command line
            argument.

     cakr - like akr but assumes the input file has a ".cpp"
            extension (with assembly code as // comments).

     cala - like calr but runs sim with the /a command line
            argument.

     calr - like alr but assumes the input file has a ".cpp"
            extension (with assembly code as // comments).


For example, to assemble and run a.mas without the debugger, 
enter 

     arun a

To assemble and run a.mas with the debugger, enter

     asim a

To run a.mac without the debugger, enter

     run a

To run a.mac with the debugger, enter

     sim a

     The batch/script files aka, akr, aks, ala, alr, als, caka, 
cakr, cala, and calr simplify assembly and linking with start-up 
code.  Start-up code is discussed in Chapter 10.  So you won't 
need these commands until you reach Chapter 10.   The following 
command 

     alr t

assembles t.mas, links with the standard start-up code (sup.mob), 
and then runs the resulting ".mac" file without the debugger. 
caka, cala, cakr and calr process files with the ".cpp" extension 
(see "reverse files" below).  The following command

     calr t

assembles t.cpp (i.e., it assembles the assembler code that 
appears in t.cpp in the form of // comments), links with the 
standard start-up code (sup.mob), and then runs the resulting 
".mac" file without the debugger.  akr and cakr work like alr and 
calr, respectively, but with ksup.mob (the stack start-up code) 
instead of sup.mob.  caka and cala are like cakr and calr, 
respectively, except the former run sim with the /a command line 
argument.

     The batch/script files aa, aka, ala, caka, and cala simplify 
the use of the program verification feature of sim (see the 
section "Automatic Program Verification" below).  They all run 
sim with the /a command line argument.  Thus, for the problems in 
the textbook, these commands will generate the log files you can 
submit for homework.  For example, to assemble and run p412.mas 
according to the answer file p412.ans, enter 

     aa p412

sim will create a log file p412.log or p412.yourname.log 
containing the results of the run.  Alternatively, you can enter 
the individual commands: 

     mas p412
     sim p412 /a


=================================================================
Caret Lines

     A ^-line (read as "caret line") is a line whose first non-
whitespace character is "^" (without the quotes).  mas processes 
^-lines last.  Thus, the effect of "^" on a line is to move that 
line to the end of the program.  ^-lines allow constants to be 
defined in line with executable code, making reading and writing 
programs easier.  It's easy to forget to define constants when 
you define them at the end of a program.  With caret lines, you 
can define constants in line as soon as you use them in your 
code, and mas then places them at the end of the program.  For 
example, consider the following code: 

          ldc    prompt
^prompt:  dw     "Enter integer"
          sout
          
          ; more executable code.
          

Although the dw is physically in line with the executable code, 
mas places it at the end of the program, out of the flow of 
control.  mas also creates a ".car" file (if the car file option 
is on and the program contains careted lines) that contains the 
original source code but with the ^-lines (now no longer starting 
with "^") at the end of the program.  For example, the code above 
would appear in the ".car" file (and in the ".lst" file) as 


          ldc    prompt
          sout
          
          ; more executable code.

; ===================== ^-lines follow ============
prompt:   dw     "Enter integer"


Notice that when mas moves a ^-line, it removes the "^".  If the 
line contains a label, the label and the ":" that follows it are 
moved to the left one position (filling in the position formerly 
occupied by the "^").  The rest of the line, however, maintains 
its columnar position.  If there is no label, then all the 
characters on a line maintain their columnar positions. 


=================================================================
SD/sd command (case sensitive when sim is enabled)

The SD (machine-level source display) command displays the ".mas" 
source code file corresponding to the program sim is currently 
executing, assuming you do NOT specify an argument.  If, however, 
you specify a file name as an argument, the SD command will 
display that file.  For example, 

     SD b.txt

displays b.txt.  However,

     SD

without an argument displays the ".mas" file corresponding to the 
".mac" file sim is executing. 

The sd (microlevel source display) command displays the ".has" or 
".vas" microcode source file corresponding to the microcode that 
sim is currently executing, assuming you do NOT specify an 
argument.  If, however, you specify a file name as an argument, 
the sd command will display that file. 

The answer files in the H1 Software Package use the SD/sd 
commands to display source code (which is then written to a log 
file).

SD/sd displays the entire file with no intermediate stops even if 
the file cannot be displayed on a single screen.  To display 
increments of source code, use the U/u commands with sim in the 
"plus source" or "source only" mode.  Alternatively, if a log 
file is active when you enter the SD/sd command, you can then use 
the LD<count>/LD/LD^ commands to display any portion of the log 
file (which would contain the contents of the file previously 
displayed by SD/sd) one screen at a time.  For example, if you 
enter 

     L    (turn on Log file)
     SD   mas.txt

you can then enter LD100t, LD^, and LD to move back and forth over the
mas.txt file, displaying one screen at a time.


=================================================================
Automatic Program Verification

     The H1 Software Package has verification data for most of 
programming assignments from the textbook STARTING FROM Chapter 
4.  This data allows sim to determine if the program you are 
running is generating the correct output for the test cases 
specified in the corresponding answer file.  An answer file 
contains debugger commands and test case data that are processed 
by sim when you enter "/a", either on the command line or from 
within the debugger.  The "/a" command also triggers the program 
verification feature of sim if verification data is available in 
the active answer file.  The H1 Software Package has an answer 
file for each programming assignment.  For example, the answer 
file for Problem 4.12 is p412.ans.  

     To try out the program verification feature, enter 

     mas caret

to assemble caret.mas.  Then enter

     sim caret

to run caret.mac.  From within the debugger, enter

     /a

sim runs caret.mac using the commands in the answer file 
caret.ans.  It also indicates on the screen (and at the bottom of 
the log file) "Program output: correct", indicating that the 
input/output activity recorded to the log file caret.log is 
correct.  

     To be correct, a program's input/output behavior must conform 
exactly to the program specifications, with respect to results, 
capitalization, and layout, except for empty lines (i.e., 
verification is insensitive to too few or too many empty lines).  

     If the problem statement in the textbook does not precisely 
define the program's behavior, there are additional 
specifications in the corresponding answer file (in the form of 
comments).  For all the problems in which you have to translate a 
C++ program (these problems are in Chapters 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 
and 15), the C++ program itself precisely defines the program's 
behavior.  Thus, none of these problems require additional 
specifications in their answer files. 

     A program must generate some output for it to be verified. 
Because the I/O instructions are introduced in Chapter 4, the 
programs from Chapters 2 and 3 do not produce output.  THUS, FOR 
CHAPTERS 2 AND 3, PROGRAM VERIFICATION IS NOT AVAILABLE.

     Here is a typical answer file (p419.ans) used in conjunction 
with program verification: 

; #0b2b
;The Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
;If there are no numbers to list, do not output anything.
;Your display should look exactly like this (with data from the
;test replacing the numbers):
;Enter number
;4
;Fibonacci numbers less than 4
;1
;1
;2
;3
n
o
ln
g
4
o
g
1
o
g
12
o
g
2
SD
q

The first line is a comment containing the verification data 
preceded by "#". 

The next 11 lines contain comments providing specific information 
on how to do the programming assignment.  

n turns off the trace (trace output would look like incorrect 
output to the verifier, resulting in a "NOT correct").  

o positions the execution point at the beginning of the program.

ln starts a new log file for the verifier to examine (data 
already in a log file before the test cases are run would look 
like incorrect output to the verifier, resulting in a "NOT 
correct"). 

Next, are the test runs: g (which runs the program) followed by 
test data which is read by the program.  Between each test case 
is o, which repositions execution at the beginning of the 
program.

SD displays the source code for the program.

q terminates the session.  A "correct"/"NOT correct" notice is 
displayed on the screen, and is inserted at the end of the log 
file created. 

     Starting with Version 6.0, sim's program verifier can check 
if a program's size and instruction counts (both machine and 
micro) are within prescribed limits (in addition to checking for 
correct output).  This additional capability is triggered 
automatically if the first line of an answer file has size and 
count data in addition to an output checksum.  For example, if 
the following is the first line of an answer file, then this 
capability is triggered: 

 ; #5364 95 93 73 519 49927
     ^   ^  ^  ^   ^   ^
     |   |  |  |   |   |
     |   |  |  |   |   +--- checksum for the preceding five data
     |   |  |  |   +------- micro inst count limit
     |   |  |  +----------- machinine inst count limit
     |   |  +-------------- microcode size limit
     |   +----------------- machine code size limit
     +--------------------- output checksum

For more information on this new capability, see the discussion 
of the /a command in sim.txt.

     It is not until Chapter 10 that you learn what happens 
when the main function in a C++ program returns a value, and how 
a return value can be used.  Thus, to avoid confusion, I have 
given a void return type to the main functions in all the 
examples and problems preceding Chapter 10.  The Microsoft and 
Borland C++ compilers compile a void main function without 
complaint.  However, g++ (the C++ compiler available on Linux, 
Sun Solaris, and Macintosh OS X) regards a void return type on 
main as an error and refuses to compile it.  To compile these 
programs with g++, you should change the return type of main to 
int and insert the statement, 

   return 0;

at the end of main.  For Chapters 7, 8, and 9, you should 
translate this return statement in main to 

   ldc   0 ; load return code into ac register
   halt    ; return to sim (the "operating system")

However, once you cover Chapter 10, you should then start 
translating the return statement as described in that chapter. 

The files in the H1 Software Package containing the end-of-
chapter problems all have main functions with an int return type 
(unlike the programs in Chapters 7, 8, and 9 in the textbook), so 
they should compile correctly on any C++ compiler. 

     If a simulation fails for any reason, sim returns a non-zero 
return code.  However, on a normal termination of a simulation 
run, sim returns the code returned by the program it has just run 
if this program is at a halt AND if the return code option is on 
(the default setting is off; you can turn it on with the mod 
program).  Otherwise, sim returns 0.  For example, consider the 
following program: 

      ldc   5
      halt

If you run this program on sim to its end with the return code 
option on, and then quit sim, sim will return 5.  If, however, 
you execute only the ldc instruction and then quit sim, sim will 
return 0.  If the return code option is off, then sim returns 0 
for both cases.  The return code returned by sim can be detected 
by batch/script files as explained in Chapter 10 (see the 
batch/script file runc and page 454 in the textbook). 


=================================================================
Reverse Comments

     Reverse comments simplify the translation of a C++ program 
to assembly code.  For example, suppose the assignment is to 
translate the following file to assembly language: 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int x;

int main() {

   x = 5;
   cout << x << endl;
   return 0;
}

You can simply add the assembly code in the form of "//" comments 
to the C++ code to get the following file: 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int x;                //x:        dw    0

int main() {          //main:

   x = 5;             //          ldc   5
                      //          st    x

   cout << x << endl; //          ld    x
                      //          dout
                      //          ldc   '\n'
                      //          aout

   return 0;          //          ldc   0
                      //          halt

}                     //          end   main

This one file can be both compiled by a C++ compiler and 
assembled by mas.  You can then easily compare the outputs 
of the two versions.  For example, the following sequence both 
assembles (with mas) and compiles (with the g++ C++ compiler) the 
above code (assuming it is in a file named t.cpp), and then runs 
the two versions: 

     g++ t.cpp -ot     (compile the C++ code in t.cpp)
     mas t.cpp         (assemble the assembly code in t.cpp)
     t                 (run the g++-produced executable)
     run t             (run the mas-produced executable on sim)

The ".lst" file that mas creates for the program above looks 
like this (note that the C++ code now appears as comments):


                                        ; #include <iostream>
                                        ; using namespace std;
0  *0    0000  x:        dw    0        ; int x;                
               
               main:                    ; int main() {          
1  *1    8005            ldc   5        ; x = 5;             
2  *2    1000            st    x
               
3  *3    0000            ld    x        ; cout << x << endl; 
4  *4    FFFD            dout
5  *5    800A            ldc   '\n'
6  *6    FFFB            aout
               
7  *7    8000            ldc   0        ; return 0;          
8  *8    FFFF            halt
                         end   main     ; }                     
9  *9    ========= end of t.cpp ==================================



mas also creates a ".mas" file in which the comments are 
reversed.  For example, for the t.cpp file above, mas creates the 
following file, named t.mas: 

                         ; #include <iostream>   
                         ; using namespace std;
x:        dw    0        ; int x;                

main:                    ; int main() {          

          ldc   5        ;    x = 5;             
          st    x

          ld    x        ;    cout << x << endl; 
          dout
          ldc   '\n'
          aout

          ldc   0        ;    return 0;          
          halt

          end   main     ; }                      

     A ".cpp" file to which you add assembler code cannot have 
any actual C++ comments--mas treats any // comment as assembler 
code.  You, however, can change the reverse comment delimiter 
that mas uses with the mod program.  For example, if you change 
it to "//.", then mas will be able to distinguish the actual C++ 
comments from the assembler code as long as the C++ comments do 
not have a "." immediately following the "//" in its comments. 

You can use both reverse commenting and ^-lines in the same 
program which, together, make translating a C++ program easier 
and less error prone.  Without ^-lines, you have to put the dw 
directives out of the flow of control (a task that is easy to 
forget).  But with ^-lines, you code dw directives in line and 
then let mas move them to the bottom of your program.  In the 
following program, a ^-line is used to define the constant -5.  
You do NOT have to use a ^-line for the end directive (or for 
public or extern) because these directives do not generate any 
code.  Thus, they may appear anywhere in a program. 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int x;                //x:        dw    0

int main() {          //main:
                      //          end   main ; don't need ^

   x = -5;            //          ldc   @_5
                      //^@_5:     dw    -5   ; need ^
                      //          st    x

   cout << x << endl; //          ld    x
                      //          dout
                      //          ldc   '\n'
                      //          aout

   return 0;          //          ldc   0
                      //          halt


=================================================================
iss program

     The iss (insert slash slash) program in the H1 Software 
Package inserts lines starting with "//" into a C++, C, or Java 
file at points you are likely to add assembly code.  It relieves 
you of the task of inserting lines on which you can add assembler 
code.  Its command line arguments are the input file name (the 
extension defaults to ".cpp" if none is given) and an optional 
repetition count (the number of lines to insert at each insertion 
point).  The default repetition count is 5.  After you add your 
assembler code, you can then use iss to remove the inserted lines 
that remain unused by using iss with a negative insertion count.  
For example, to remove all unused lines that were previously 
inserted into t.cpp (assuming 10 or fewer were previously 
inserted at each insertion point), enter 

     iss t /-10

The negative count should be as large or larger than the 
insertion count used to insert lines into the file.  Note that

     iss t -10

and

     iss t /10


are equivalent.  That is, both commands insert 10 lines.  The 
hyphen in 

     iss t -10

is not a minus sign.  Rather, it's the argument marker.  Thus, the 
repetition count is +10.  In

     iss t --10

the repetition count is -10.  Here, the first hyphen is the 
argument marker; the second is the minus sign.  Thus, this 
command deletes up to 10 lines.  

iss backs up its input file in a file whose extension is ".iss".  
For example, if you enter 

     iss t

iss will back up the original t.cpp file in t.iss.  For more 
information see iss.txt. 

     An alternative to reverse comments is to run mas against the 
original ".cpp" file.  mas will create a corresponding ".mas" 
file in which all the C++ code appears as ";" comments.  You can 
then add assembler code to this ".mas" file.  Thus, the assembler 
program you create will be commented with the corresponding 
C++ code.  However, you will not be able to both compile and 
assemble the same file, as you can with reverse comments. 


=================================================================
LN Command

     The LN (log new) debugger command creates and turns on a new 
log file.  LN makes it easy  to create the proper log files for a 
programming assignment.


=================================================================
Modified D and U commands 

The D and U commands now accept a second argument (an ending 
address) which allows you to precisely control what is displayed. 


=================================================================
Using breakpoint to start at main

      When running a program linked with start-up code (see 
Chapter 10), you will probably want to position execution at main 
before you start examining the trace output from the debugger. 
To do this, simply enter 

     ms             (source display; assuming sim disabled)
     bmain          (set breakpoint at main)
     g              (execute until main is reached)


=================================================================
Trying out atest and ltest (Chapter 11)

     The batch/script files atest and ltest simplify the testing 
of your versions of masv1 and linv1 (the assembler and linker you 
write in Chapter 11 of the textbook), respectively.  atest and 
ltest run both your version and the model version and compare 
results.  The software package contains both sample student 
versions (masv1 and linv1) and the model versions (masv1m and 
linv1m).  Thus, you can try out atest and ltest before you write 
your own versions of masv1 and linv1.  When you write your own 
versions of masv1 and linv1, you should replace the sample 
student executables (masv1 and linv1 but NOT masv1m and linv1m) 
in the software package with the executable versions of your 
programs.  

     If "java" is an argument to atest or ltest, the model 
version is compared with the student-written java version in 
masv1.class or linv1.class.  For example, 

     atest java

compares the output of masv1m (the model version of masv1) with 
the output from masv1.class (provided by you).  The software 
package does not contain a sample version of masv1.class.  Thus, 
the command above (with the java argument) will not work until 
masv1.class is made available by you.  Similarly, 

     ltest java 

will not work until linv1.class is made available by you.
However, both 

      atest

and

      ltest

work using the files provided by the software package (try them).

                    How to Use lin Version 6.1

Quick Start

     lin (LINker) links together a collection of ".mob"
and/or ".mac" modules, producing a ready-to-run ".mac" file.  To
use lin, enter

     lin

lin then prompts the user for the names of the files that are to 
be linked.  Enter these names and/or any other desired command line 
arguments (any number of items per input line).  lin will 
continue to prompt until the user hits ENTER without first 
entering an argument.  lin then links all the files specified, 
and creates a ".mac" file whose basename is the basename of the 
first input file processed. 
     If a module name entered has no extension, ".mob" is 
appended to it.  An input file can be a ".mac" or a ".mob" file.


Command Line Arguments

     All command line arguments are optional, can be specified in
any order, must have no embedded spaces, and must be separated by
at least one space.

     All command line arguments, except <infilename>, must have a
leading "/" or "-".

     All command line arguments are case insensitive, except for
filenames on systems with case-sensitive filenames.

     The format of the command line is

lin  <argument> <argument> . . .

where <argument> can be

<infilename>
/h or /?
/i or /s
/a<ansfilename>
/l<libfilename>
/t<tabfilename> or /n
/cat or /ncat
/o<outfilename>

If one or more input file names or answer files are specified on 
the command line, then lin will not prompt the user for 
additional input.  If an input file name on the command line 
starts with a pathname that starts with "/", then substitute "//" 
for the leading "/" in the pathname when entering the input file 
name.

If lin detects an error in an argument ON THE COMMAND LINE, it 
generates an error message and terminates execution.  If, on the 
other hand, lin detects an error in an argument entered IN 
RESPONSE TO A PROMPT, lin does not terminate.  It, instead, 
allows the user to reenter. 

More than one <infilename> may be specified.  If an <infilename>
has no extension, ".mob" is appended to it.

/h or /? displays a help screen.

If /i is specified, the processing of PUBLIC and EXTERN symbols 
is case insensitive.  If /s is specified, the processing of 
PUBLIC and EXTERN symbols is case sensitive.  If neither /i nor 
/s is specified, then the default setting is used (see the 
section "Default Settings" below). 

More than one /a<ansfilename> may be specified.  An answer file
contains a list of files names, one name per line.  Each file
specified is included in the link process.  If /a is specified
but not followed by a file name, then the answer file name
defaults to "lin.ans".

If /l<libfilename> is specified and unresolved external 
references remain after all the input files have been linked, 
then the library specified by <libfilename> is searched.  If a 
module is found in this library that can resolve one or more of 
the external references, that module is linked.  lin repeatedly 
searches and links modules from the library (or libraries, if 
more than one is specified) until either all external references 
have been resolved, or no modules can be found that resolve those 
that do exist.  In the latter case, lin generates an error 
message and terminates.  More than one /l<libfilename> may be 
specified.  

If /t is specified, a table file is created showing the P, E, R, 
and S tables and the machine text that lin builds.  If /t is 
specified but not followed by a file name, then <tabfilename> 
defaults to <outfilename_less_extension>.tab.  If <tabfilename> 
has no extension, ".tab" is appended to it.  If /n is specified, 
a table file is not created.  If neither /t nor /n is specified, 
then the default setting is used (see the section "Default 
Settings" below). 

<outfilename> is the name of the executable (".mac") file to be 
created. If <outfilename> has no extension, ".mac" is appended to 
it.  If /o<outfilename> is omitted, then the output file name 
defaults to the basename of the first input file to which ".mac" 
is appended. 


Cat File

     lin can create a "cat file" which is the concatenation of 
the ".lst" files, suitably filtered, corresponding to all the 
input files.  Its base name is the same as the output file.  Its 
extension is ".cat".  If some input files have missing ".lst" 
files, lin will still build a cat file using those ".lst" files 
that are available.  

     The addresses given in the cat file at the start of each 
line of code are relocated--that is, they correspond to locations 
in the ".mac" file created by lin.  However, the hex machine code 
shown for each instruction is not relocated. 

     The cat file is needed by sim for source-level debugging.  

     If the command line argument /cat is specified, lin creates 
a cat file.  If /ncat is specified, lin does not create a cat 
file.  If neither /cat nor /ncat is specified, then the default 
setting is used (see the section "Default Settings" below). 
 

Search Path for Library, Answer Files, sup.mob, and ksup.mob

     If a directory is specified by the /l argument, lin searches 
for the library file in that directory.  Otherwise, lin searches 
for the library file in the current directory and in the 
directory specified by the H1DIR environment variable, if any, in 
that order.  lin follows the same search pattern for answer 
files, sup.mob, and ksup.mob. 


Problem with a Leading "/" in Command Line Arguments on Non-
Microsoft Systems

     Command line arguments typically start with "/" on Microsoft 
systems, and with "-" on other systems.  For the sake of 
uniformity, all the programs in the H1 Software Package allow a 
command line argument to start with EITHER "/" or "-" on any of 
the supported platforms.  Unfortunately, allowing "/" to start a 
command line argument on non-Microsoft systems can cause a 
problem.  For example, suppose you want to specify an input file 
on the command line.  Recall that an input file argument is not 
preceded by an argument marker.  For example in, 

    sim a /ms

the argument "a" (which specifies the input file a.mac) does NOT 
have a preceding "/" or "-".  "/ms", on the other hand, has the 
argument marker "/".  "/ms" is interpreted as the "/m" argument 
followed by the secondary argument "s".  Now suppose the input 
file you want to specify on the command line is 

     /abc.x

This denotes the abc.x file in the root directory "/".  
Unfortunately, all the programs in the H1 Software Package will 
interpret a leading "/" as an argument marker rather than as the 
root directory.  Thus, 

     /abc.x

on the command line is incorrectly interpreted as the argument 

     /a 

followed by the secondary argument

     bc.x

This problem does not occur on Microsoft systems because they use 
"\" rather than "/" as the filename separator, and, thus, there 
is never any confusion with the argument marker "/". 

You will probably rarely run into this problem because full 
pathnames are rarely needed when using the programs in the H1 
Software Package.  However, if the problem does occur, it can 
easily be circumvented: simply use "//" to represent the root.  
For example, if 

     //abc.x

appears on a command line, it is interpreted as the input file

     /abc.x

Do NOT use "//" in place of "/" within a command line argument.
For example, in the following invocation of sim,

     sim a /m/mnt/floppy/s.hor

the microcode file /mnt/floppy/s.hor is specified within the /m 
command line argument.  Thus, "//" should NOT be used in place of 
the leading "/" in "/mnt/floppy/s.hor". 


Default Settings

     lin is shipped with the following default settings:

          label status:     case sensitive
          table status:     table on
          cat file status:  cat file on
          message status:   messages on (i.e., non-error/non-warning
                            console messages are displayed) 

These settings, however, can be changed with the mod program.  For
information on the mod program, see mod.txt.

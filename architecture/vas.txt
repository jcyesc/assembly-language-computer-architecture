                    How to Use vas Version 6.1

Quick Start 

     vas (Vertical microcode ASsembler) translates the symbolic 
vertical microcode described in 

  ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE AND COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE USING C++ AND JAVA
           by Anthony J. Dos Reis, Course Technology, 2004

to binary microcode.  The output file produced can then be used 
with sim.  

     To invoke vas, enter 

     vas

vas then prompts the user for the name of the input file 
containing the source program (i.e., the program to be 
translated).  Enter an input file name and/or other desired 
command line arguments (any number of items per input line).  If 
an input file name entered has no extension, ".vas" is appended 
to it.  After an input file name is entered, vas translates the 
source program and outputs its binary form to a file whose name 
is 

     <infilename_less_extension>.ver
  
The ".ver" extension is used to designate files containing 
vertical microcode in binary form. 

     Each line of the source program should be in the following 
format (square brackets surround optional items): 

 [<label>  :] [<opcode_name> [<operand>] [<operand>]]  [/<comment>]

<label> may start in any column.  <label> may be any sequence of 
letters, digits, "@", "$", and "_" that does not start with a 
digit 0 to 9.  <comment> may be any sequence of characters.  
Zero, one, or two <operand> fields should be specified, depending 
on the instruction.  At least one space should separate the 
<opcode_name> and <operand> fields.  Spaces are optional to the 
left and right of the colon following <label>.  A semicolon may 
be used in place of the "/" at the start of a comment.  
Completely blank lines and lines with only "<label> :" are 
allowed. 


Command Line Arguments

     All command line arguments are optional, can be specified in 
any order, must have no embedded spaces, and must be separated by 
at least one space. 

     All command line arguments, except <infilename>, must have a 
leading "/" or "-". 

     All command line arguments are case insensitive, except for 
filenames on systems with case-sensitive filenames. 

     The format of the command line is

vas <infilename> /h /dec /i /l<lstfilename> /c<cfgfilename> /o<outfilename>
                 /? /hex /s /n

If <infilename> is specified on the command line, then vas will 
not prompt the user for additional input.  In response to a 
prompt, the user can enter <infilename> and/or other command line 
arguments.  Prompting ends whenever the user enters <infilename>.  
If <infilename> has no extension, then ".vas" is appended to it. 
If <infilename> starts with a pathname that starts with "/", then 
substitute "//" for the leading "/" in the pathname when entering 
<infilename>.  

/h or /? displays a help screen.

If /dec is specified, a number specifying a memory address in the 
source program is treated as decimal, unless it ends with an "h" 
or "H", in which case it is treated as hexadecimal.  If /hex is 
specified, a number is treated as hex, unless it ends with a "t" 
or "T" ("t" stands for base ten), in which case it is treated as 
a decimal.  If neither /dec nor /hex is specified, then the 
default setting is used (see the section "Default Settings" 
below).

If /i is specified, label processing is case insensitive.  If /s 
is specified, label processing is case sensitive.  If neither /i 
nor /s is specified, then the default setting is used (see the 
section "Default Settings" below). 

If /l is specified, a list file is generated.  If /n is specified, 
a list file is not generated.  If neither /l nor /n is specified, 
then the default setting is used (see the section "Default 
Settings" below).  A list file name can optionally follow /l.  If 
a list file name is specified without an extension, then ".vst" 
is appended to it.   If the /l argument is specified without a 
filename, then the filename used is 

     <infilename_less_extension>.vst

Each line in a list file is truncated, if necessary, to avoid 
wraparound on an 80 column display. 

The /c argument is used to specify a configuration file.  If a 
configuration file name is specified without an extension, ".cfg" 
is appended to it.  A configuration file provides vas with the 
register-name/register-number correspondence.  The configuration 
file should be in the same format as that used by sim.  See 
sim.txt for more information on configuration files.  If the /c 
argument is not specified, vas will use the configuration file 
whose name is 

     <infilename_less_extension>.cfg

if it exists.  If it does not exist, vas uses its default 
configuration (which corresponds to s.cfg).
                                     
The /o argument is used to specify the name of the output file 
(i.e., the file to which the binary microcode is written).  If 
<outfilename> has no extension, then ".ver" is appended to it.  
If the /o argument is omitted, then <outfilename> defaults to 

     <infilename_less_extension>.ver


Register Names and Numbers

     Registers should be specified using their names that appear 
in the configuration file.  If the configuration file does not 
specify a name for a register, the register name defaults
to is hex number without any leading zeros.

An additional register can be specified in the shift 
instructions.  This extra register is assembled into the B field 
of the microinstruction.  If a microcode file has one or more 
shift operations with an additional register greater than 0, then 
sim will activate the barrel shifter when it loads that 
microcode.  Caution: when the barrel shifter is active, the 
one-register shift microinstruction shifts 0 positions (because 
its B field contains 0, and register 0 contains 0).  For example, 

     right ac ac

is assembled into the same instruction as

     right ac ac 0

It shifts one position when the one-position shifter is active, 
but it shifts zero positions when the barrel shifter is active. 


Search Path for Configuration File

     If a directory is specified by the /c argument, vas searches 
for the configuration file in that directory.  Otherwise, vas 
searches for the configuration file in the current directory and 
in the directory specified by the H1DIR environment variable, if 
any, in that order. 

     If the /c argument is not used, vas searches for a 
configuration file in the directory containing the input file, 
and the directory specified by the H1DIR environment variable, if 
any, in that order.  It searches for a file whose name is 

     <infilename_less_extension>.cfg


Problem with a Leading "/" in Command Line Arguments on Non-
Microsoft Systems

     Command line arguments typically start with "/" on Microsoft 
systems, and with "-" on other systems.  For the sake of 
uniformity, all the programs in the H1 Software Package allow a 
command line argument to start with EITHER "/" or "-" on any of 
the supported platforms.  Unfortunately, allowing "/" to start a 
command line argument on non-Microsoft systems can cause a 
problem.  For example, suppose you want to specify an input file 
on the command line.  Recall that an input file argument is not 
preceded by an argument marker.  For example in, 

    sim a /ms

the argument "a" (which specifies the input file a.mac) does NOT 
have a preceding "/" or "-".  "/ms", on the other hand, has the 
argument marker "/".  "/ms" is interpreted as the "/m" argument 
followed by the secondary argument "s".  Now suppose the input 
file you want to specify on the command line is 

     /abc.x

This denotes the abc.x file in the root directory "/".  
Unfortunately, all the programs in the H1 Software Package will 
interpret a leading "/" as an argument marker rather than as the 
root directory.  Thus, 

     /abc.x

on the command line is incorrectly interpreted as the argument 

     /a 

followed by the secondary argument

     bc.x

This problem does not occur on Microsoft systems because they use 
"\" rather than "/" as the filename separator, and, thus, there 
is never any confusion with the argument marker "/". 

You will probably rarely run into this problem because full 
pathnames are rarely needed when using the programs in the H1 
Software Package.  However, if the problem does occur, it can 
easily be circumvented: simply use "//" to represent the root.  
For example, if 

     //abc.x

appears on a command line, it is interpreted as the input file

     /abc.x

Do NOT use "//" in place of "/" within a command line argument.
For example, in the following invocation of sim,

     sim a /m/mnt/floppy/s.hor

the microcode file /mnt/floppy/s.hor is specified within the /m 
command line argument.  Thus, "//" should NOT be used in place of 
the leading "/" in "/mnt/floppy/s.hor". 


Default Settings

     vas is shipped with the following default settings:

     number base:       decimal
     label status:      case sensitive
     list file status:  list on
     message status:    messages on (i.e., non-error/non-warning
                        console messages are displayed) 

These settings, however, can be changed with the mod program.  For 
information on the mod program, see mod.txt.

           REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS

General Requirements        


1)  Use the mod program to incorporate your name into the sim 
    executable file.  Your name will then appear in all log files 
    you create with sim.  To do this, at the command line enter 

         mod sim /r

    At the prompt, enter your name (family name first, then your 
    given name and middle initial, if any, each separated by at 
    least one space).  IMMEDIATEDLY PRECEDE YOUR FAMILY NAME WITH 
    A PERIOD.  The period causes the log files sim creates to 
    have an extension that includes your family name in lower 
    case (this feature is not supported on DOS).  For example, if 
    you enter 
    
         .DosReis Anthony J
    
    then the log files sim creates will have the extension 
    ".dosreis.log".  Do NOT include in your family name any 
    embedded spaces or characters that cannot be part of a file 
    name.  If you share your last name with someone else in your 
    class, omit the spaces separating the parts of your name. 
    That way your log file names will contain your entire name.  
    For example, enter 

         .DosReisAnthonyJ 
    
    in which case your log files will have the extension 
    ".dosreisanthonyj.log".   
    
    By incorporating your name into log file names, your 
    instructor can keep the log files for an entire class in a 
    single directory without any file name conflicts.  
    
    If you do not submit your homework electronically (i.e., you 
    hand in hardcopy printouts), then there is no need to 
    incorporate your name into log file names.  In this case, you 
    should STILL enter your name using the mod command, but 
    WITHOUT the leading period.  Your name will then appear 
    within your log files but will not be incorporated into log 
    file names. 

2)  Place a comment containing your name at the beginning of
    all your programs.

3)  The name of the files containing your programs should have 
    the base name of the form 

         p<chapternumberproblemnumber>
   
    For example, use the file name "p412.mas" for your program 
    for Problem 4.12.  The file name should start with a lower 
    case 'p'.  Do NOT insert any separating characters within the 
    file's basename.  For example, do NOT use the name 
    "p4_12.mas".  Do NOT add leading zeros to the problem number.  
    For example, do NOT use the name "p0412.mas".  This naming 
    convention requirement DOES NOT APPLY to the problems from 
    Chapter 2.  For these problems, you enter your program 
    directly into memory using the e command, so there is no file 
    to name. 

4)  If your program does not work, use the debugger to determine 
    the error.  With the debugger, you should always be able to 
    find any errors in your program.  Take advantage of the LD 
    command (log display) debugger command to examine your log 
    file during a session, or print out the log file and then 
    carefully examine the printout off line until you find the 
    error. 

5)  If your program accepts input, you should test it with a 
    variety of inputs to ensure that it is working correctly.  
    Use a set of test cases that provides a reasonably 
    comprehensive test of your program.  Whenever possible, use 
    test cases for which you know or can easily determine the 
    correct output.

6)  To get the required log file to hand in, enter 

         /a 

    from within the debugger when running your finished program 
    (you can also specify /a on the command line when invoking 
    sim).  For this command to work correctly, you MUST follow 
    the naming convention given in requirement 3 above.  When the 
    /a command is entered, sim executes the debugger commands in 
    the answer file corresponding the to ".mac" file it is 
    running.  These commands create a log file containing 
    everything required for your homework assignment (program 
    statistics, test runs, and source code).  For example, for 
    Problem 4.12, you should create an assembly language file 
    p412.mas which assembles to p412.mac.  When you run p412.mac 
    on sim and enter /a, sim uses the answer file p412.ans to 
    create the log file p412.log (or p412.<yourfamilyname>.log, 
    depending on your response to requirement 1 above). 

    Answer files for most of the programming problems from the 
    textbook are in the H1 Software Package. 

    For the programming assignments in Chapter 2, you enter 
    "none" for the machine code file name.  You then enter your 
    program directly into memory using the e command.  Because 
    sim is not running a ".mac" file (i.e., a machine code file) 
    from which it can determine the answer file, you must 
    explicitly specify the answer file in the /a command.  For 
    example, to create the log file (whose name will be p21.log 
    or p21.<yourfamilyname>.log) for Problem 2.1, you should enter 
    
         /ap21
    
    For most of the programming assignments in Chapter 4 and 
    later, the /a command will also verify the correctness of 
    your program.  You will see on your screen and in the log 
    file created an evaluation, such as "Program output: correct" 
    or "Program output: NOT correct", indicating the results of 
    the verification test.  Programming assignments in Chapters 2 
    and 3 do not generate output (because the output instructions 
    not introduced until Chapter 4).  Thus, sim cannot verify the 
    programs for Chapters 2 and 3. 

7)  Check to see if the ".ans" file corresponding to each 
    programming assignment has additional instructions on how to 
    do the assignment.  These additional instructions, if any, 
    appear in the ".ans" file as comments and do not affect the 
    operation of the ".ans" file.  You must follow these 
    instructions precisely or else your program will not pass the 
    verification test performed by sim.  In addition to the 
    correct results, your program's output must have the 
    specified capitalization and layout, except for empty lines 
    Too few or too many empty lines do not affect program 
    verification.  

8)  Submit your log files to your instructor. Consult with your 
    instructor for directions on how to do this. 

9)  Report any suspected bugs in the software package to your 
    instructor and to the author of the textbook 
    (email address: dosreist@newpaltz.edu). 

===============================================================

Requirements for assembly language programs NOT translated 
from C++ programs


10) All programs should contain plenty of comments.  Comments are 
    particularly important in assembly language programs.  Use 
    blank lines or comment lines containing all equal signs to 
    divide your program into its component parts. For example: 

    ; Your name

       First part of a program

    ;=================================================

       Second part of a program

    ;=================================================

       Third part of a program

    
11) Use the naming conventions for constants presented in the 
    textbook.  For example, for the constants +2 and -2, use the 
    labels @2 and @_2, respectively. 
    
12) All programs should be properly formatted.  For example, 
    see Figure 3.10b on page 73 of the textbook and Figure 7.1 
    on page 269. 

13) Use meaningful identifiers.  For example, use "sum" rather 
    than "x" for a variable that holds a sum.

14) Precede any input statement with a prompt message that 
    clearly specifies what input is needed.  Prompt messages 
    should have a professional look and layout.  Pay particular 
    attention to spacing and spelling.  For example, do NOT do 
    this: 

       enter   nonnegtve int:55

    Do this:

       Enter non-negative integer: 55

    Or do this:

       Enter non-negative integer
       55

15) Label all output meaningfully.  Labels should have a 
    professional look and layout.  Pay particular attention to 
    spacing and spelling.  Always output a newline at the end of 
    the last output.  For example, do NOT do this: 

       summ =15

    Do this:

       Sum = 15

16) Structure your program in a sensible way.  Do NOT write 
    "spaghetti code" (code whose execution pattern is like a bowl 
    of spaghetti because of an excessive and inappropriate use of 
    jump instructions).  Your programs should not be 
    unnecessarily complex or inefficient. 

===============================================================
    
Requirements for assembly language programs translated from 
C++ programs

17) Translate C++ programs EXACTLY as a dumb compiler would.  DO 
    NOT CHANGE IN ANY WAY the C++ program you are translating, 
    even if the C++ program does not conform to good programming 
    practices.  For example, if a C++ program generates unlabeled 
    output, the translated assembly language program should 
    correspondingly generate unlabeled output.  The output your 
    assembly language program generates should match EXACTLY the 
    output the C++ program generates (including identical spacing 
    and capitalization). 

18) Add your assembly code to the C++ program in the form of "//" 
    comments.  You do not have to type in the C++ programs--they 
    are all in the H1 Software Package under the names 

          p<chapternumberproblemnumber>.cpp

    For example, the source code for the C++ program in Problem 
    7.32 is in p732.cpp.  To create a solution for Problem 7.32, 
    you  should first run the iss (insert slash slash) program on 
    P732.cpp.  This program adds lines to p732.cpp that start 
    with "//".  Next, you add your assembly code on these "//" 
    lines.   To assemble your code, enter 

         mas p732.cpp

    to create p732.mac.  Note: you MUST specify the ".cpp" 
    extension in the command above.  Otherwise, mas assumes the 
    ".mas" extension.  To create the log file to hand in, enter 
    /a when you run p732.mac on sim. 

    For example, suppose the following C++ program is in the file 
    example.cpp: 

         #include <iostream>
         using namespace std;
         int x;
         int main() 
         {
            x = 5;
            cout << x << endl;
            return 0;
         }
    

    To add the "//" lines, enter

         iss example.cpp

    which converts example.cpp to the following (iss adds 5 "//"
    lines at every likely insertion point):

         //; iss of example.cpp  Your name: 
         //
         //
         //
         //
         //
         #include <iostream>
         using namespace std;
         int x;
         //
         //
         //
         //
         //
         int main() 
         //
         //
         //
         //
         //
         {
           x = 5;
         //
         //
         //
         //
         //
           cout << x << endl;
         //
         //
         //
         //
         //
           return 0;
         //
         //
         //
         //
         //
         }    
         //
         //
         //
         //
         //


    Next, using the proper format for assembly code (see 
    requirement 12 above), add your assembly code on the "//" 
    lines to get: 


         //; iss of example.cpp  Your name: Anthony J. Dos Reis
         //
         //
         //
         //
         //
         #include <iostream>
         using namespace std;
         int x;
         //x:       dw    0
         //
         //
         //
         //
         int main() 
         //main:
         //         end   main
         //
         //
         //
         {
           x = 5;
         //         ldc   5
         //         st    x
         //
         //
         //
           cout << x << endl;
         //         ld    x
         //         dout
         //         ldc   '\n'
         //         aout
         //
           return 0;
         //         ldc   0
         //         halt
         //
         //
         //
         }    
         //
         //
         //
         //
         //


    To remove the unused "//" lines, enter

         iss /-5 example.cpp

    The negative sign on "-5" tells iss to remove lines (up
    to 5 consecutive unused lines at every insertion point).  
    example.cpp becomes the following:


         //; iss of  example.cpp  Your name: Anthony J. Dos Reis
         #include <iostream>
         using namespace std;
         int x;
         //x:       dw    0
         int main() 
         //main:
         //         end   main
         {
           x = 5;
         //         ldc   5
         //         st    x
           cout << x << endl;
         //         ld    x
         //         dout
         //         ldc   '\n'
         //         aout
           return 0;
         //         ldc   0
         //         halt
         }    


    Now assemble example.cpp with

         mas example.cpp

    Note that in the command above, you MUST specify the ".cpp" 
    extension for the example.cpp file (otherwise, mas assumes 
    the extension ".mas").  mas then produces example.mac (the 
    executable file translated from the assembler code on the 
    "//" lines), example.lst  (the list file), and 
    example.mas (the "reverse" file in which the C++ code appears 
    as comments).   Here is the reverse file, example.mas, 
    produced by mas (note the  C++ code now appears as comments): 

         ; iss of  example.cpp  Your name: Anthony J. Dos Reis
                                 ; #include <iostream>
                                 ; using namespace std;
                                 ; int x;
         x:       dw    0
                                 ; int main() 
         main:
                  end   main
                                 ; {
                                 ;   x = 5;
                  ldc   5
                  st    x
                                 ;   cout << x << endl;
                  ld    x
                  dout
                  ldc   '\n'
                  aout
                                 ;   return 0;
                  ldc   0
                  halt
                                 ; }    


    To run example.mac, enter

         sim example 

    To generate a log file (assuming the answer file example.ans 
    is available), enter 

         /a

    Alternatively, specify /a on the command line when you invoke 
    sim (in which case the debugger in sim is not activated): 

         sim example /a

    For more information on the iss program, see iss.txt in the
    H1 Software Package.

19) Do NOT add any comments to your assembly language programs
    except for your name at the beginning.  The C++ code itself
    is adequate commenting.

                    How to Use has Version 6.1

Quick Start 

     has (Horizontal microcode ASsembler) translates the symbolic 
horizontal microcode described in 

  ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE AND COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE USING C++ AND JAVA
           by Anthony J. Dos Reis, Course Technology, 2004

to binary microcode.  The output file produced can then be used 
with sim.  

     To invoke has, enter 

     has

has then prompts the user for the name of the input file 
containing the symbolic microcode to be translated.  Enter the 
input file name and/or other desired command line arguments (any 
number of items per input line).  If the input file name entered 
has no extension, ".has" is appended to it.  As command line 
arguments are entered, has continues to prompt for more arguments 
until an input file name it entered. 

     has outputs a file named

     <infilename_less_extension>.hor

The ".hor" extension is used to designate files containing 
horizontal microcode in binary form. 

     Each line of the source program should be in the following
format (the square brackets surround optional items):

[<label> :]   [<symbolic_microinstruction>]  [/ <comment>]

<label> may start in any column.  <label> may be any sequence of 
letters, digits, "@", "$", and "_" that does not start with a 
digit 0 to 9.  <comment> may be any sequence of characters.  
Spaces are optional to the left and right of the colon following 
<label>.  Unlike the input files for mas and vas, a semicolon may 
NOT be used in place of "/" at the start of a comment.  Blank 
lines and lines with only "<label> :" are allowed. 


Command Line Arguments

     All command line arguments are optional, can be specified in 
any order, must have no embedded spaces, and must be separated by 
at least one space. 

     All command line arguments, except <infilename>, must have a 
leading "/" or "-". 

     All command line arguments are case insensitive, except for 
file names on systems with case-sensitive file names. 

     The format of the command line is

has <infilename> /h /dec /i /l<lstfilename> /c<cfgfilename> /o<outfilename>
                 /? /hex /s /n

If <infilename> is specified on the command line, then has will 
not prompt the user for additional input.  In response to a 
prompt, the user can enter <infilename> and/or other command line 
arguments.  Prompting ends whenever the user enters <infilename>.  
If <infilename> has no extension, then ".has" is appended to it. 
If <infilename> starts with a pathname that starts with "/", then 
substitute "//" for the leading "/" in the pathname when entering 
<infilename>.  

/h or /? displays a help screen.

If /dec is specified, a number specifying a memory address in the 
source program is treated as decimal, unless it ends with an "h" 
or "H", in which case it is treated as hexadecimal.  If /hex is 
specified, a number is treated as hex, unless it ends with a "t" 
or "T" ("t" stands for base ten), in which case it is treated as 
a decimal.  If neither /dec nor /hex is specified, then the 
default setting is used (see the section "Default Settings" 
below).

If /i is specified, labels are case insensitive.  If /s is
specified, labels are case sensitive.  If neither /i nor /s
is specified, then the default setting is used (see the section
"Default Settings" below).

If /l is specified, a list file is generated.  If /n is specified, 
a list file is not generated.  If neither /l nor /n is specified, 
then the default setting is used (see the section "Default 
Settings" below).  A list file name can optionally follow /l.  If 
a list file name is specified without an extension, then ".hst" 
is appended to it.  If the /l argument are specified without a 
file name, then the file name used is 

     <infilename_less_extension>.hst

Each line in a list file is truncated, if necessary, to avoid 
wraparound on an 80 column display. 

The /c argument is used to specify a configuration file.  If a 
configuration file name is specified without an extension, ".cfg" 
is appended to it.  A configuration file provides has with the 
register-name/register-number correspondence.  The configuration 
file should be in the same format as that used by sim.  See 
sim.txt for more information on configuration files.  If the /c 
argument is not specified, has will use the configuration file 
whose name is 

     <infilename_less_extension>.cfg

if it exists.  If it does not exist, has uses its default 
configuration (which corresponds to s.cfg). 

The /o argument is used to specify the name of the output file 
(i.e., the file to which the binary microcode is written).  If 
<outfilename> is specified without an extension, then ".hor" is 
appended to it.  If the /o argument is omitted, then 
<outfilename> defaults to 

     <infilename_less_extension>.hor


Operators

     Operators may appear in either the infix or prefix 
positions.  Parentheses surrounding the operands, and commas 
separating the operands are optional.  Spaces are required 
only if their omission would result in ambiguity.  For example,

     pc = add( pc, 1 ) ;

can be written as

     pc=add(pc,1);

or as

     pc=add pc 1;

but not as

     pc = addpc1;

     No more than one of the following operators can be specified 
in a single microinstruction: 

     Addition is specified with "+" or "add".  For example, 

          pc = pc + 1;
          pc = add(pc, 1);

     Subtraction is specified with "-" or "sub".  For example, 

          ac = ac - f;
          ac = sub(ac, f);

     Multiplication is specified with "*" or "mult".  For 
     example, 

          ac = ac * f;
          ac = mult(ac, f);

     Bitwise complementation is specified with "~" or "flip".  
     For example, 

          ac = ~b;
          ac = flip(b);

     Bitwise AND is specified with "&" or "and".  For example:

          ac = mdr & xmask;
          ac = and(mdr, xmask);

     Left shift is specified with "left" or "<<".  For example:

          dc = <<ir;
          dc = left(ir);

     Right shift is specified with "right" or ">>".  For example:

          ac = >>ac;
          ac = right(ac);

An additional register can be specified for shift operations. 
For example,

     ac = right(ac, ir);

This extra register is assembled into the B field of the 
microinstruction.  If a microcode file has one or more 
microinstructions specifying a shift operation whose B field is  
greater than 0, then sim will automatically activate the barrel 
shifter when it loads that microcode.  Caution: when the barrel 
shifter is active, the standard shift microinstruction shifts 
zero positions (i.e., it has no effect) because its B field 
contains 0, and register 0 contains 0.  For example, 

     ac = right(ac);

is assembled to the same binary microinstruction as

     ac = right(ac, 0);

It shifts one position when the one-position shifter is active, 
but it shifts zero positions when the barrel shifter is active. 

                       
sz

The left side of an assignment can be "sz", in which case the
right side is not loaded into any register.  It, however, is 
routed straight through the ALU, causing the S and Z bits to be 
set.  Thus, these bits can be tested with an if statement.
For example:

     sz = ac; if (s) goto loop;
     sz = ac + 1; if (s) goto goodval;
     sz = left(ac); if (z) goto gotzero;

The effect of sz is to cause has to place 0 into the C register field.  
Because register 0 is a read-only register, it will not be 
loaded with a new value.  Thus, the following two instructions
are equivalent:

     sz = ac; if (s) goto loop;
     0 = ac;  if (s) goto loop;


if

     The condition tested can be either S (which is true if the 
sign bit of the ALU output is 1) or Z (which is true if the ALU 
output is zero).  Parentheses around the condition are optional.


goto

The target of a goto can be either a label or an absolute 
address.


Register Names and Numbers

     Registers should be specified using their names that appear 
in the configuration file.  If the configuration file does not 
specify a name for a register, the register name defaults
to is hex number without any leading zeros.


Register-to-field Mapping

     has places registers into microinstructions fields as 
required by the data path of H1.  For example, in the 
instruction, 

     pc = pc + 1; mar = pc;

pc must be in the B field (so it can reach the mar).  Thus, has 
assigns pc to the B field even though it is the left operand in 
"pc + 1". 


Search Path for Configuration File

     If a directory is specified by the /c argument, has searches 
for the configuration file in that directory.  Otherwise, has 
searches for the configuration file in the current directory and 
in the directory specified by the H1DIR environment variable, if 
any, in that order. 
     If the /c argument is not used, has searches for a 
configuration file in the directory containing the input file, 
and the directory specified by the H1DIR environment variable, in 
that order.  It searches for a file whose name is 

     <infilename_less_extension>.cfg


Problem with a Leading "/" in Command Line Arguments on Non-
Microsoft Systems

     Command line arguments typically start with "/" on Microsoft 
systems, and with "-" on other systems.  For the sake of 
uniformity, all the programs in the H1 Software Package allow a 
command line argument to start with EITHER "/" or "-" on any of 
the supported platforms.  Unfortunately, allowing "/" to start a 
command line argument on non-Microsoft systems can cause a 
problem.  For example, suppose you want to specify an input file 
on the command line.  Recall that an input file argument is not 
preceded by an argument marker.  For example in, 

    sim a /ms

the argument "a" (which specifies the input file a.mac) does NOT 
have a preceding "/" or "-".  "/ms", on the other hand, has the 
argument marker "/".  "/ms" is interpreted as the "/m" argument 
followed by the secondary argument "s".  Now suppose the input 
file you want to specify on the command line is 

     /abc.x

This denotes the abc.x file in the root directory "/".  
Unfortunately, all the programs in the H1 Software Package will 
interpret a leading "/" as an argument marker rather than as the 
root directory.  Thus, 

     /abc.x

on the command line is incorrectly interpreted as the argument 

     /a 

followed by the secondary argument

     bc.x

This problem does not occur on Microsoft systems because they use 
"\" rather than "/" as the filename separator, and, thus, there 
is never any confusion with the argument marker "/". 

You will probably rarely run into this problem because full 
pathnames are rarely needed when using the programs in the H1 
Software Package.  However, if the problem does occur, it can 
easily be circumvented: simply use "//" to represent the root.  
For example, if 

     //abc.x

appears on a command line, it is interpreted as the input file

     /abc.x

Do NOT use "//" in place of "/" within a command line argument.
For example, in the following invocation of sim,

     sim a /m/mnt/floppy/s.hor

the microcode file /mnt/floppy/s.hor is specified within the /m 
command line argument.  Thus, "//" should NOT be used in place of 
the leading "/" in "/mnt/floppy/s.hor". 


Default Settings

     has is shipped with the following default settings:

     number base:       decimal
     label status:      case sensitive
     list file status:  list on
     message status:    messages on (i.e., non-error/non-warning
                        console messages are displayed) 

These settings, however, can be changed with the mod program.  For 
information on the mod program, see mod.txt.
